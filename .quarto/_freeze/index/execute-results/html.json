Each section includes written notes, a video (with the same content as the notes) and practice questions. It's chunked into bitesized sections to allow you make progress in 10 min windows. You may like to try the questions first and then just go back to the notes if you get stuck. Feel free to start anywhere you like.\n\nThis is a work in progress, the videos are appearing and things may change! If you find a mistake please email edrs20@bath.ac.uk and good luck!\n",
