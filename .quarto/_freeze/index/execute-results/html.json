There is no right or wrong way to use it. Each section includes written notes, a video (with the same content as the notes) and practice questions. It's chunked into bitesized sections to allow you make progress in 10 min windows. You may like to try the questions first and then just go back to the notes if you get stuck. Feel free to start anywhere you like.\n\n<img src=\"img/desmos.gif\" style=\"float: left;\" height=\"75px\"><p>The graphs and diagrams created in <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator\">desmos</a> are interactive just click on the <em>edit in desmos button</em> to open the desmos graph in a new tab.</p>\n\nThis is a work in progress, the videos are appearing and things may change!
