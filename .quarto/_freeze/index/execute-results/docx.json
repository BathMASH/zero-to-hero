Each section includes written notes, a video (with the same content as the notes) and practice questions. It's chunked into bitesized sections to allow you make progress in 10 min windows. You may like to try the questions first and then just go back to the notes if you get stuck. Feel free to start anywhere you like.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nThe videos are hosted on the University's Panopto Re:view server. You will have to login to watch them - it mau also force a pop-up window.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/docx/unnamed-chunk-1_521bf06604f6d04737ef6d076b0c767c'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a work in progress, the videos are appearing and things may change!
