There is no right or wrong way to use it. Each section includes written notes, a video (with the same content as the notes) and practice questions. It's chunked into bitesized sections to allow you make progress in 10 min windows. You may like to try the questions first and then just go back to the notes if you get stuck. Feel free to start anywhere you like.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nThe videos are hosted on the University's Panopto Re:view server. You will have to login to watch them - it may also force a pop-up window.\n:::\n\n\n\nThis is a work in progress, the videos are appearing and things may change! If you find a mistake please email edrs20@bath.ac.uk and good luck!\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Let me know what you think\n\nIf you've got some spare time to [fill in this survey](https://bathreg.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/zero-to-hero) about this resource, I'd love to know what you think of it.\n:::\n\nZero to Hero Â© 2023 by Ed Southwood, Skills Centre, University of Bath is licensed under [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n",
