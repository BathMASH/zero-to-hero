Straight line graphs are produced by linear equations. Linear equations like $y=2x+4$ only have $x$ to the power of one only. Note: this doesn't just apply to $x$, it could be whatever variable you are using.\n\n## Coordinates\n\nTo build a picture of a function we work out pairs of values that satisfy the function. Take for example $y=\\frac{1}{2}x+1$. If we choose values of $x$ we can work out the corresponding $y$ values.\n\n| $x$ | $y$ |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| $0$ | $\\frac{1}{2}(0)+1=1$ |\n| $1$ | $\\frac{1}{2}(1)+1=1.5$ |\n| $2$ | $\\frac{1}{2}(2)+1=2$ |\n\nOnce we have these values they can be plotted on graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](06-straight_line_graphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jzyasdusre?embed)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe red dots show the points and the blue line shows the equation.\n\nBy working out some co-ordinates in the following question try to generate the correct line. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](06-straight_line_graphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)](https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/question/68532/linear-graphs-plotting-1-integer-values/embed/?token=c4963f30-f814-4d6f-91bc-b631f0ed1ec3)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The formula for a straight line graph: $y=mx+c$\n\nStraight line graphs can be defined by two quantities. The gradient, $m$, a measure of how steep the line is, and the $y$ intercept, $c$, where the line crosses the $y$ axis.\n\n### The y intercept: $c$\n\nThe $y$ intercept is where line crosses the $y$ axis. We can quickly work out the co-ordinate by substituting $x=0$ into the equation of a line, or, by noticing the constant term in equation where $y=mx+c$. Here are two examples:\n\nFor the line $y = 3x +4$, the $y$ intercept is at $(0,4)$ i.e. it crosses the $y$ axis at $4$. We can check this by substituting $x=0$ into the equation.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny &= 3x +4 \\\\\n  &= 3(0) +4 \\\\\n  &= 3\\times0 +4 \\\\\ny &= 4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe need to be careful with the next example: $y + 2 = 5x$. It's tempting to say that the $y$ intercept is $2$ but it's not. First we must re-arrange the equation into the form of $y=mx+c$. We'll use the idea of doing the same thing to both sides again.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny +2 &= 5x \\\\\n y+2-2 &= 5x-2 \\\\\n y &= 5x-2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOnce we've done this we can see that the intercept is when $y=-2$. Notice if we substituted $x=0$ in the original equaiton we would get this answer too.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny +2 &= 5x \\\\\n y+2 &= 5(0) \\\\\n y +2 &= 0 \\\\\n y &= -2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nClick on the graph below and play with the slider for $c$. Notice how the graph moves up and down.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](06-straight_line_graphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/llcrsdgmvo?embed)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### The gradient: $m$\n\nThe gradient of a graph is a measure of how much steep the line is. The value of $m$ is the change in the $y$ axis for each increase of $1$ in the $x$ axis. So a gradient of $m=2$ would mean the $y$ values increase by $2$ for each increase of $1$ in the $x$ direction. This is a positive gradient. Contrast this to a value of $m$ such as $-0.5$. This means for each increase of $1$ in the $x$ direction, the corresponding $y$ value decreases by $0.5$ or a half. This is a negative gradient.\n\nThe gradient can also be found by calculating the change in the $y$ direction divided by the change in the $x$ direction. The graph below shows how you could calculate the gradient of the line. The line shown has a gradient of $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Pro tip\n\nA change in a quantity is often represented by the Greek letter delta, $\\Delta$, so we can rewrite $m$ as: $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](06-straight_line_graphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/a3c9vcaede?embed)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nClick on the graph below and then change the value of $m$ with the slider. Notice how the gradient changes but the $y$ intercept stays the same.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](06-straight_line_graphs_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z9r3fkyrcf?embed)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n* $m$ is the gradient - the amount $y$ changes for an incease in $1$ in the $x$ direction\n* $c$ where the line crosses the $y$ axis\n* $m$ and $c$ only make sense when the line is in the form $y=mx+c$\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n## Different notation - same thing\n\nThe equation of a straight line can be written using different letters.
