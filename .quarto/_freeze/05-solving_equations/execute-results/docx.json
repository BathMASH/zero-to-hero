To work out the value we are free to apply any mathematical operation we like to the equation so long as we *do the same to both sides*. \n\nNote: We can't quite do any operation. Division by zero, $\\div 0$, is not allowed as it is undefined. \n\n## Linear equations\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='05-solving_equations_cache/docx/unnamed-chunk-1_9adb8de188c2feae5228298f2bd3e3b4'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Single unknown\n\nKeeping the idea of doing the same thing to both sides in mind lets solve the following equation by *undoing* each operation with it's inverse.\n\n$$\n3x + 8 = 10\n$$\nFirst subtract $8$ from each side.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 3x+8 -8 &= 10 -8 \\\\\n3x &= 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow divide both sides by $3$ to find the value of one $x$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{3x}{3} &= \\frac{2}{3} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe nice thing here is that we can leave the answer as $\\frac{2}{3}$. No need to find a decimal fraction if we don't need to.\n\nSolve the following equations by applying the same operation to both sides. Remember the questions come with full solutions, so, if you get stuck have a look at the answers and then try a different one.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='05-solving_equations_cache/docx/unnamed-chunk-2_67d96e2785516e0edb43b8057a3f9cee'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](05-solving_equations_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)](https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/question/90637/equations-linear-equations-1a-rational-answers/embed/?token=8b0eebe4-9011-49a1-a3aa-d0a1298634be)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Unknown on both sides\n\nIf the unknown appears twice in an equation collect the unknown like terms first and then solve as before.\n\nGiven $\\frac{4y}{y-9}=-2$, we can multiply both sides by $(y-9)$ to get rid of the fraction, then get all the $y$s on one side, then finally solve as before.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{4y}{y-9} &= -2 \\\\\n\\frac{4y}{y-9} \\times (y-9) &= -2 \\times (y-9) \\\\\n\\frac{4y}{\\cancel{y-9}} \\times \\cancel{(y-9)} &= -2 \\times y -2 \\times -9 \\\\\n4y &= -2y + 18 \\\\\n4y + 2y &= -2y + 18 +2y\\\\\n6y &= 18\\\\\n\\frac{6y}{6} &= \\frac{18}{6}\\\\\ny &= 3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n* To solve equations do the same thing to both sides.\n* If the unknown appears twice - collect like terms first.\n:::\n\nHave a go at some questions.

Here are some examples. \n\nAddition and subtraction work.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 1 &< 2 \\\\\n1 + 5 &< 2 + 5\\\\\n6 &< 7\\\\\n&\\checkmark&\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 1 &< 2 \\\\\n1 -4 &< 2 -4\\\\\n-3 &< -2\\\\\n&\\checkmark\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemember $-3$ is less than $-2$ since it is further to the left on a number line. In other words $-3$ is more negative than $-2$.\n\nMultiplication and division work as expected with positive numbers.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 4 &< 6 \\\\\n4 \\times 2 &< 6 \\times 2\\\\\n8 &< 12\\\\\n&\\checkmark\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 4 &< 6 \\\\\n4 \\div 2 &< 6 \\div 2\\\\\n2 &< 3\\\\\n&\\checkmark\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe need to be careful when multiplying and dividing by negative numbers.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 4 &< 6 \\\\\n4 \\times -2 &< 6 \\times -2\\\\\n-8 &\\nless -12\\\\\n-8 &> -12\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nRemember the following key point when using inequalities: \n\nWhen multiplying or dividing by a negative number change the direction of the inequality.\n:::\n\n## Simultaneous equations\n\nSometimes equations have more than one unknown. Take $x + y = 4$ for example. There are infinitely many pairs of numbers, $x$ and $y$, that work for this. Take the following pairs for example: $x = 1$ and $y=3$, $x = -100$ and $y=104$, and $x = 0.1$ and $y=3.9$. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Pro-tip \n\nThese pairs of solutions are often given as co-ordinate pairs like $(1,3)$, $(-100,104)$ and $(0.1,3.9)$. We'll do more about co-ordinates later.\n:::\n\nHowever, if I give you some more information, say $x = y$, now there is only one solution, namely $x = 2$ and $y=2$. We can use the information in two equations together to find the values that satisfy both equations.\n\n### Elimination method\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='05-solving_equations_cache/docx/unnamed-chunk-5_82d0f070b3dc7d22c3d7fe1dc10519da'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe idea with this method is to combine the two equations to create a new equation with only one variable in it. \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x + 2y &= -6 &(1)\\\\\n-2x + 3y &= 7 &(2)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo get a solution for $y$, if we multiply equation $(2)$ by $2$ we will have two equations with equal and opposite x-coefficients:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x + 2y &= -6   \\\\\n-4x + 6y &= 14 &(3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf we add equation $(1)$ to equation $(3)$ this eliminates the $x$-terms, leaving us with one equation in terms of $y$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(2+6)y &= -6 + 14   \\\\\n8y &= 8 \\\\\ny &= 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo obtain a solution for $x$ we can substitute this $y$-value into either of our initial equations. Using equation $(1)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x + 2 \\times 1 &= -6 \\\\\n4x + 2 &= -6 \\\\\n4x &= -8 \\\\\nx &= -2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe can check our values for $x$ and $y$ by substituting them into equation $2$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-2x + 3y &= 7 \\\\\n-2 \\times -2 + 3 \\times 1 &= 7 \\\\\n4 + 3 &= 7\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhich works out!\n\nYou can try other examples in the exercise below. Sometime you may have to multiply both of your starting equations in order to get the same amount of one variable. Also, don't worry if you have eliminated the other variable - it doesn't matter which you get rid of first, you should get the same answer in the end.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='05-solving_equations_cache/docx/unnamed-chunk-6_ecdbe3e0431324adda07cdb9f7fec87f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](05-solving_equations_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)](https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/question/104646/simultaneous-equations-linear-equations-with-integer-solutions/embed/?token=22ea59f8-3c89-478a-acd8-d114edcba808)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Substitution method\n\nIt is also possible to re-arrange one equation and substitute it into the other. This method will be covered in the [Quadratics](#07-quadratics.qmd) section.\n",
