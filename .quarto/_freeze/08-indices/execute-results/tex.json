In this section we move beyond the idea that powers are just repeated multiplications. \n\n## Index notation\n\nBeing comfortable moving between different ways to write powers helps when rearranging algebra.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n* $x^0 = 1$ except when $x=0$ then it's undefined\n* $x^{-n} = \\frac{1}{x^n}$\n* $x^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]x$\n:::\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n$$\n2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nMore generally.\n$$\nx^{-3} = \\frac{1}{x^3}\n$$\nAnything to the power of zero is $1$:\n$$\n\\pi^0 = 1\n$$\nRemember good old $\\pi$? From working stuff out about circles $\\pi = 3.14159...$\n\nWe can write square roots:\n\n$$\n16^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{16} = \\pm4\n$$\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Pro tip\nWhen taking square roots remember there are two possible solutions. Since in the above example $4 \\times 4 = 16$ and  $-4 \\times -4 = 16$. So either answer is just fine.\n:::\n\nHere's an example of a cube root.\n\n$$\n8^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\n$$\n\n### Combinations, roots and powers\n\nA roots and powers can be combined. If a number is raised to the power of a fraction you find the root corresponding to the denominator and then raise it to the power of the numerator. For example:\n\n$$\n8^{\\frac{2}{3}} = (\\sqrt[3]{8})^2 = (2)^2 = 4\n$$\n\nCube root, because of the $3$ in the denominator, then square the answer because of the $2$ in the numerator. This sequence could be done the other way around, square first then cube root, I choose this way since the numbers stay smaller.\n\n### Reciprocals\n\nIf you raise a number to the power of $-1$ you find it's reciprocal (you **flip it**). For example:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\n### But why?\n\nJust like we did with negative numbers we can extend the idea of what a power means by following a pattern. Here's a pattern to justify $x^0 = 1$ and $x^{-n} = \\frac{1}{x^n}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 10^3 &= 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 & = 1000 \\\\\n10^2 &= 10 \\times 10 & = 100 \\\\\n10^1 &= 10 & = 10 \\\\\n10^0 &= 1 & = 1 \\\\\n10^{-1} &= \\frac{1}{10} & = 0.1 \\\\\n10^{-2} &= \\frac{1}{10 \\times 10} & = 0.01 \\\\\n10^{-3} &= \\frac{1}{10 \\times 10 \\times 10} & = 0.001 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nI'll come back to the justification about square roots after the next section.\n\n## Rules of indices\n\nThere is a neat set of rules we can use when combining numbers with indices:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n* $x^n \\times x^m = x^{n+m}$\n* $x^n \\div x^m = x^{n-m}$\n* $(x^n)^m = x^{n \\times m}$\n:::\n\nWhen you multiply terms you add the powers.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 3x^4 \\times 5x^6 &= 3 \\times 5 \\times x^4 \\times x^5 \\\\\n&= 15 \\times x^{4+5} \\\\\n&= 15x^9\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLets put it all together with a complicated example:\n\nTo rewrite $\\dfrac{\\sqrt[4]{x^5x^3}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}}$ in the form $x^n$, we need to use the following rules:\n\n1. $a^n a^m = a^{n+m}$;\n2. $\\sqrt[n]{a} = a^{1/n}$;\n3. $\\left(a^n\\right)^m = a^{n \\times m}$;\n4. $\\frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m}$.\n\nWe will simplify the numerator and denominator separately to make the steps clearer. Firstly, applying rule 1, then rule 2, and then rule 3 to the numerator:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{\\sqrt[4]{x^5x^3}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} &= \\dfrac{\\sqrt[4]{x^8}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} \\\\\n &= \\dfrac{(x^8)^{1/4}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} \\\\\n &= \\dfrac{x^2}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo simplify the denominator, we want to apply rule 2, then rule 3, and then rule 1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{x^2}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} &= \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{1/3} (x^3)^{1/6}} \\\\\n &= \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{1/3} x^{1/2}} \\\\\n &= \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{5/6}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemember that we'll need to get common denominators when adding the fractions at the end:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} &= \\frac{1\\times2}{3\\times2}  + \\frac{1\\times3}{2\\times3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{6}  + \\frac{3}{6} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5}{6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, applying rule 4 and simplifying, \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{5/6}} &=x^2 \\times x^{-5/6} \\\\\n &= x^{2-5/6} \\\\\n &= x^{12/6-5/6} \\\\\n &= x^{7/6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLots of work with fractions here! \n\nNow try these questions. Don't worry if it takes a while to just solve one!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n[![](08-indices_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)](https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/question/64712/indices-change-of-notation-3/embed/?token=246845ab-e1ea-4745-9106-5750be81ed2c)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### But why? Square roots\n\nAs promised here is an explanation of why $x^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]x$.\n\nWhen we take a square root we look for the a number that when it is multiplied by it's self we get the answer i.e. $? \\times ? = x$. Since one $x$ is the same as $x^1$ we can rewrite out statement again:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} ? \\times ? &= x^1 \\\\\nx^? \\times x^? &= x^1 \\\\\nx^{?+?} &= x^1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis means $? + ? = 1$ so $?=\\frac{1}{2}$ so $x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{x}$.\n",
