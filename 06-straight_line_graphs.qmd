It is often useful to plot graphs of functions to gain an understanding of what they mean. Straight line graphs are produced by linear equations. Linear equations like $y=2x+4$ only have $x$ to the power of one only. Note: this doesn't just apply to $x$, it could be whatever variable you are using.

## Coordinates

To build a picture of a function we work out pairs of values that satisfy the function. Take for example $y=\frac{1}{2}x+1$. If we choose values of $x$ we can work out the corresponding $y$ values.

| $x$ | $y$ |
|:---:|:---:|
| $0$ | $\frac{1}{2}(0)+1=1$ |
| $1$ | $\frac{1}{2}(1)+1=1.5$ |
| $2$ | $\frac{1}{2}(2)+1=2$ |

Once we have these values they can be plotted on graph.

The red dots show the points and the blue line shows the equation.

## The formula for a straight line graph: $y=mx+c$

Straight line graphs can be defined by two quantities. The gradient, $m$, a measure of how steep the line is, and the $y$ intercept, $c$, where the line crosses the $y$ axis.

### The y intercept: $c$

The $y$ intercept is where line crosses the $y$ axis. We can quickly work out the co-ordinate by substituting $x=0$ into the equation of a line, or, by noticing the constant term in equation where $y=mx+c$. Here are two examples:

For the line $y = 3x +4$, the $y$ intercept is at $(0,4)$ i.e. it crosses the $y$ axis at $4$. We can check this by substituting $x=0$ into the equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= 3x +4 \\
  &= 3(0) +4 \\
  &= 3\times0 +4 \\
y &= 4
\end{aligned}
$$

We need to be careful with the next example: $y + 2 = 5x$. It's tempting to say that the $y$ intercept is $2$ but it's not. First we must re-arrange the equation into the form of $y=mx+c$. We'll use the idea of doing the same thing to both sides again.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y +2 &= 5x \\
 y+2-2 &= 5x-2 \\
 y &= 5x-2
\end{aligned}
$$

Once we've done this we can see that the intercept is when $y=-2$. Notice if we substituted $x=0$ in the original equaiton we would get this answer too.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y +2 &= 5x \\
 y+2 &= 5(0) \\
 y +2 &= 0 \\
 y &= -2
\end{aligned}
$$

Click on the graph below and play with the slider for $c$. Notice how the graph moves up and down.

### The gradient: $m$

The gradient of a graph is a measure of how much steep the line is. The value of $m$ is the change in the $y$ axis for each increase of $1$ in the $x$ axis. So a gradient of $m=2$ would mean the $y$ values increase by $2$ for each increase of $1$ in the $x$ direction. This is a positive gradient. Contrast this to a value of $m$ such as $-0.5$. This means for each increase of $1$ in the $x$ direction, the corresponding $y$ value decreases by $0.5$ or a half. This is a negative gradient.

The gradient can also be found by calculating the change in the $y$ direction divided by the change in the $x$ direction. The graph below shows how you could calculate the gradient of the line. The line shown has a gradient of $\frac{2}{3}$.

## Pro tip

A change in a quantity is often represented by the Greek letter delta, $\Delta$, so we can rewrite $m$ as: $m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$

Click on the graph below and then change the value of $m$ with the slider. Notice how the gradient changes but the $y$ intercept stays the same.

:::{.callout-note}
* $m$ is the gradient - the amount $y$ changes for an incease in $1$ in the $x$ direction
* $c$ where the line crosses the $y$ axis
* $m$ and $c$ only make sense when the line is in the form $y=mx+c$

## Different notation - same thing

The equation of a straight line can be written using different letters. They all mean the same thing. You may see:

* $y = mx + b$
* $y = mx + y_0$
* $y = ax + b$

Using your knowledge of $y=mx+c$ try the following questions. Don't be afraid to look at the answers and then try a fresh set of questions if it seems tricky at first.
