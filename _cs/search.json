The rules for deciding if the answer is positive or negative are below:\nNotice that the order is not important. Here are some examples: \\[\n-2 \\times 3 = -6\n\\] \\[\n10 \\times -5 = -50\n\\] \\[\n-4 \\times -6 = 24\n\\] If you have more that two numbers to multiplying you can just count the number of negative numbers and apply the following rule:\nHere’s a longer example: \\[\n-2 \\times -2 \\times -2 \\times -2 = 16\n\\] since there are even number of negatives in the question the answer will be positive.\nSince division and multiplication are so closely related, division works in exactly the same way. For example: \\[\n\\frac{-3 \\times -6}{-9} = -2\n\\].\nYou can practice these techniques with the following questions. You can refresh the question to change the numbers.

    "text": "1.2 Addition and subtraction\n\n\n\n\nIt helps to think about addition and subtraction of negative numbers on a number line. We can think about positive numbers as arrows pointing forwards, shifts to the right from zero, and negative numbers as arrows backwards, shifts to the left. Add to this the idea that addition and subtraction is then combining these arrows. When you add two numbers you place them one after another, the end of the second arrow on the tip of the first. With subtraction you reverse the direction of the second arrow and then place them together just like addition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following examples:\n\n\\(3 - 5 = -2\\) can be thought of as: start at three then move five back to the left.\n\\(-4 + 1 = -3\\), start at \\(-4\\) then move one to the right.\n\\(5 + - 2 = 3\\), start at \\(5\\) then add on a shift of \\(2\\) to the left.\n\\(1 - - 3 = 4\\), start at \\(1\\) then reverse a shift of \\(3\\) to the left (I know it seams bonkers!). The double negative cancels out to give a calculation equivalent to \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt’s tempting to cling on to the idea that two negatives make a positive when it comes to addition and subtraction. But consider the following statements, they are all correct, but imagine how easy it is to be confused if you just apply the two negatives make a positive rule.\n\n\\(-3 - 5 = -8\\)\n\\(-10 - -4 = -6\\)\n\n\n\nYou can practice these techniques with the following questions.

    "text": "2.1 Substitution\nIn order to evaluate an algebraic expression we have to substitute the letters for numbers. After the numbers are written in place of the letters we must take care to evaluate the statement in the correct order. BIDMAS is often used to remember the order:\nOne more thing to know before we start making substitutions is that the multiplication symbol \\(\\times\\) is often not used in algebraic expressions. Letters and numbers that are next to each other are multiplied together. For example \\(3a\\) means \\(3 \\times a\\). You can show two numbers multiplied together like this \\(2 \\times 3 = (2)(3) = 6\\).\nHere are some examples:\nIf \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=-3\\) then we can evaluate \\(5a + 4b\\) like this: \\[\n5(2) + 4(-3)\n\\] When things are written next to each other this means multiplication. \\[\n5\\times 2 + 4 \\times -3\n\\] Using BIDMAS to do the multiplication first and remembering that a positive number multiplied by a negative gives a negative number. \\[\n10 +- 12 = -2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(n = 3\\) and \\(x = 2\\) into \\(5x^n\\). By replacing the letters with numbers we have: \\[\n5(2)^3\n\\] Remembering that when things are next to each other it means multiplication, which gives: \\[\n5 \\times 2^3\n\\] Following BIDMAS we must deal with the powers first. Since \\(2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\) we have: \\[\n5 \\times 8 = 40\n\\]\nFinally consider \\(\\frac{2p+q}{r}\\) where \\(p=6\\), \\(q=3\\) and \\(r=5\\). Replacing the letters with numbers we have: \\[\n\\frac{2(6)+3}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 6+3}{5}\n\\] Remembering that there are implicit brackets in fractions, the numerator needs to be evaluated first. \\[\n\\frac{(2 \\times 6+3)}{5} = \\frac{(12+3)}{5}=\\frac{15}{5}\n\\] Now the fraction can be evaluated. \\[\n\\frac{15}{5} = 3\n\\] You can practice these techniques with the following questions.

    "text": "2.2 Simplification\n\n\n\n\nAlgebraic expressions are made up of terms. Similar terms can be combined to create a simplified expression, this processes is called collecting like terms. For example \\(2a + 3a\\) can be simplified to \\(5a\\) by collecting the \\(a\\) terms. Here’s another example with a bit more going on:\n\\[\n5x + 7y - 3x + 3y = \\overbrace{5x - 3x}^{x\\text{ terms}} + \\overbrace{7y + 3y}^{y\\text{ terms}} = 2x + 10y\n\\] Notice that the like terms were grouped first to make it easier to simplify. Also, each term owns the positive or negative symbol ahead of it.\nTerms can be more complex too. Although it’s tempting to find something to simplify there are no like terms in this expression: \\(3xy + 6x^2 + 2x - 5y\\). Only the exact same multiples can be simplified. For example:\n\\[\n6x^2 + 2x - 5x^2 -8x = \\overbrace{6x^2 -5x^2}^{x^2\\text{ terms}} + \\overbrace{2x-8x}^{x\\text{ terms}}=x^2-6x\n\\] Notice that the two different types of term are \\(x\\) and \\(x^2\\). Also, I could have written \\(1x^2\\) but we normally don’t bother with the \\(1\\). It’s also important to note that capitalisation matters; \\(x\\) is different from \\(X\\).\nTake care when simplifying multiples of different letters \\(3xy + 5yx\\) can be simplified. This is because the order of multiplication doesn’t matter so \\(3xy + 5yx = 3xy + 5xy = 8xy\\). Terms are normally written in alphabetical order with the highest powers first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey point:\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\times x = x^2\\)\n\\(x + x = 2x\\)\n\\(x\\) is different from \\(X\\)\n\\(1x\\) is written as \\(x\\)\n\n\n\nHave a go at simplifying with these questions.",

In other words the top of the first fraction with the top of the second one and so on. After the multiplication you may be able to cancel down the fraction. Just like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} &= \\frac{2 \\times 3}{5 \\times 4} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6}{20} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3 \\times 2}{10 \\times 2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3 \\times \\cancel{2}}{10 \\times \\cancel{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{10}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-tip\n\n\n\nIt is possible to cancel before multiplying.

We keep the first fraction as it is. Change the division, \\(\\div\\), symbol to a multiplication, \\(\\times\\), and flip the last fraction - swap the places of the numerator and denominator. This is called taking the reciprocal of the fraction. For example:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{3}{7} \\div \\frac{5}{2} &= \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3 \\times 2}{7 \\times 5} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6}{35}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

    "text": "5.3 Simultaneous equations\nSometimes equations have more than one unknown. Take \\(x + y = 4\\) for example. There are infinitely many pairs of numbers, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), that work for this. Take the following pairs for example: \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y=3\\), \\(x = -100\\) and \\(y=104\\), and \\(x = 0.1\\) and \\(y=3.9\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-tip\n\n\n\nThese pairs of solutions are often given as co-ordinate pairs like \\((1,3)\\), \\((-100,104)\\) and \\((0.1,3.9)\\). We’ll do more about co-ordinates later.\n\n\nHowever, if I give you some more information, say \\(x = y\\), now there is only one solution, namely \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y=2\\). We can use the information in two equations together to find the values that satisfy both equations.\n\n5.3.1 Elimination method\n\n\n\n\nThe idea with this method is to combine the two equations to create a new equation with only one variable in it.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x + 2y &= -6 &(1)\\\\\n-2x + 3y &= 7 &(2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo get a solution for \\(y\\), if we multiply equation \\((2)\\) by \\(2\\) we will have two equations with equal and opposite x-coefficients:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x + 2y &= -6   \\\\\n-4x + 6y &= 14 &(3)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we add equation \\((1)\\) to equation \\((3)\\) this eliminates the \\(x\\)-terms, leaving us with one equation in terms of \\(y\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(2+6)y &= -6 + 14   \\\\\n8y &= 8 \\\\\ny &= 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo obtain a solution for \\(x\\) we can substitute this \\(y\\)-value into either of our initial equations. Using equation \\((1)\\), we obtain:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x + 2 \\times 1 &= -6 \\\\\n4x + 2 &= -6 \\\\\n4x &= -8 \\\\\nx &= -2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can check our values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by substituting them into equation \\(2\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-2x + 3y &= 7 \\\\\n-2 \\times -2 + 3 \\times 1 &= 7 \\\\\n4 + 3 &= 7\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhich works out!\nYou can try other examples in the exercise below. Sometime you may have to multiply both of your starting equations in order to get the same amount of one variable. Also, don’t worry if you have eliminated the other variable - it doesn’t matter which you get rid of first, you should get the same answer in the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Substitution method\nIt is also possible to re-arrange one equation and substitute it into the other. This method will be covered in the Quadratics section.",

    "text": "7.2 The formula for a straight line graph: \\(y=mx+c\\)\nStraight line graphs can be defined by two quantities. The gradient, \\(m\\), a measure of how steep the line is, and the \\(y\\) intercept, \\(c\\), where the line crosses the \\(y\\) axis.\n\n7.2.1 The y intercept: \\(c\\)\nThe \\(y\\) intercept is where line crosses the \\(y\\) axis. We can quickly work out the co-ordinate by substituting \\(x=0\\) into the equation of a line, or, by noticing the constant term in equation where \\(y=mx+c\\). Here are two examples:\nFor the line \\(y = 3x +4\\), the \\(y\\) intercept is at \\((0,4)\\) i.e. it crosses the \\(y\\) axis at \\(4\\). We can check this by substituting \\(x=0\\) into the equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny &= 3x +4 \\\\\n  &= 3(0) +4 \\\\\n  &= 3\\times0 +4 \\\\\ny &= 4\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe need to be careful with the next example: \\(y + 2 = 5x\\). It’s tempting to say that the \\(y\\) intercept is \\(2\\) but it’s not. First we must re-arrange the equation into the form of \\(y=mx+c\\). We’ll use the idea of doing the same thing to both sides again.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny +2 &= 5x \\\\\ny+2-2 &= 5x-2 \\\\\ny &= 5x-2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOnce we’ve done this we can see that the intercept is when \\(y=-2\\). Notice if we substituted \\(x=0\\) in the original equaiton we would get this answer too.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny +2 &= 5x \\\\\ny+2 &= 5(0) \\\\\ny +2 &= 0 \\\\\ny &= -2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nClick on the graph below and play with the slider for \\(c\\). Notice how the graph moves up and down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphs and diagrams created in desmos are interactive just click on the edit in desmos button to open the desmos graph in a new tab.\n\n\n\n7.2.2 The gradient: \\(m\\)\nThe gradient of a graph is a measure of how much steep the line is. The value of \\(m\\) is the change in the \\(y\\) axis for each increase of \\(1\\) in the \\(x\\) axis. So a gradient of \\(m=2\\) would mean the \\(y\\) values increase by \\(2\\) for each increase of \\(1\\) in the \\(x\\) direction. This is a positive gradient. Contrast this to a value of \\(m\\) such as \\(-0.5\\). This means for each increase of \\(1\\) in the \\(x\\) direction, the corresponding \\(y\\) value decreases by \\(0.5\\) or a half. This is a negative gradient.\nThe gradient can also be found by calculating the change in the \\(y\\) direction divided by the change in the \\(x\\) direction. The graph below shows how you could calculate the gradient of the line. The line shown has a gradient of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip\n\n\n\nA change in a quantity is often represented by the Greek letter delta, \\(\\Delta\\), so we can rewrite \\(m\\) as: \\(m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the graph below and then change the value of \\(m\\) with the slider. Notice how the gradient changes but the \\(y\\) intercept stays the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphs and diagrams created in desmos are interactive just click on the edit in desmos button to open the desmos graph in a new tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\) is the gradient - the amount \\(y\\) changes for an incease in \\(1\\) in the \\(x\\) direction\n\\(c\\) where the line crosses the \\(y\\) axis\n\\(m\\) and \\(c\\) only make sense when the line is in the form \\(y=mx+c\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent notation - same thing\n\n\n\nThe equation of a straight line can be written using different letters. They all mean the same thing. You may see:\n\n\\(y = mx + b\\)\n\\(y = mx + y_0\\)\n\\(y = ax + b\\)\n\n\n\nUsing your knowledge of \\(y=mx+c\\) try the following questions.

There can be:\n\ntwo different values that satisfy the equation\none repeated value\nno real values (only imaginary ones - and yes that is a thing!)\n\nHere are some methods to solve quadratic equations.\n\n8.3.1 Factorisation\n\n\n\n\nWe can solve some quadratics by factorisation. Take for example the following equation \\(x^2 + 8x = -12\\). To solve via factorisation we must first make it equal to zero and then factorise. So we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} x^2 + 8x &= -12 \\\\\nx^2 + 8x +12 &= -12 +12 \\\\\nx^2 + 8x +12 &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, with a little sense of deja vu (see the example in the previous section) we can factorise our quadratic to get \\((x+2)(x+6)=0\\). Notice that this is one bracket multiplied by another to get the answer zero. When this happens, i.e. when you multiply two numbers and the answer is zero, either the first number is zero or the second one is. This means either \\(x+2=0\\) or \\(x+6=0\\). Solving these two mini-equations gives the two solutions: either \\(x=-2\\) or \\(x=-6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip\n\n\n\nWe can quickly get from the factorised quadratic to the solutions by flipping the signs in the bracket.\n\n\nTry some questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Quadratic Formula\n\n\n\n\nFor a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) we can use the quadratic formula to find solutions for \\(x\\).\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nWe can use the formula on the equation \\(x^2 -4x +2 = 0\\). In this example the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are:\n\n\\(a=1\\) since \\(x^2\\) means \\(1 \\times x^2\\)\n\\(b=-4\\) notice how the negative sign is owned by the \\(x\\) coefficient\n\\(c=2\\) finially we just have \\(2\\)\n\nSubstituting into the quadratic formula we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} x &= \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-8}}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is possible to simplify the square roots in this answer to give \\(2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\). So don’t be surprised if your calculator gives you that answer.\nFinally, we must deal with the \\(\\pm\\) symbol. This means do the calculation once using addition, \\(+\\), and another time using subtraction, \\(-\\). This will give two possible answers for \\(x\\), given to \\(2\\) decimal places.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} x_1 &= \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{8}}{2} \\\\\n&= 3.41\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} x_2 &= \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{8}}{2} \\\\\n&= 0.59\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip\n\n\n\nNotice the use of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). It is common in maths to use subscript numbers to show different particular values of the same variable. That’s all it’s doing \\(x_1\\) is just a value for \\(x\\) named \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) is just a value for \\(x\\) named \\(x_2\\).",

The easiest way to do this is to use equation \\((3)\\). This gives, \\(y_1 =1.15\\) and \\(y_2 = -0.75\\). Note, to maintain accuracy you’ll need to put your full values for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) into equation (3) and then round to \\(2\\) decimal places afterwards.\nThis gives two pairs of numbers for our answer. \\((x_1,y_1) = (-0.08,1.15)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)=(0.88,-0.75)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip\n\n\n\nnotice our answers look a lot like co-ordinates on a graph.

Since in the above example \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) and \\(-4 \\times -4 = 16\\). So either answer is just fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Combinations, roots and powers\nA roots and powers can be combined. If a number is raised to the power of a fraction you find the root corresponding to the denominator and then raise it to the power of the numerator. For example:\n\\[\n8^{\\frac{2}{3}} = (\\sqrt[3]{8})^2 = (2)^2 = 4\n\\]\nCube root, because of the \\(3\\) in the denominator, then square the answer because of the \\(2\\) in the numerator. This sequence could be done the other way around, square first then cube root, I choose this way since the numbers stay smaller.\n\n\n9.1.2 Reciprocals\nIf you raise a number to the power of \\(-1\\) you find it’s reciprocal (you flip it). For example:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n\n9.1.3 But why?\nJust like we did with negative numbers we can extend the idea of what a power means by following a pattern. Here’s a pattern to justify \\(x^0 = 1\\) and \\(x^{-n} = \\frac{1}{x^n}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} 10^3 &= 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 & = 1000 \\\\\n10^2 &= 10 \\times 10 & = 100 \\\\\n10^1 &= 10 & = 10 \\\\\n10^0 &= 1 & = 1 \\\\\n10^{-1} &= \\frac{1}{10} & = 0.1 \\\\\n10^{-2} &= \\frac{1}{10 \\times 10} & = 0.01 \\\\\n10^{-3} &= \\frac{1}{10 \\times 10 \\times 10} & = 0.001\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nI’ll come back to the justification about square roots after the next section.",

Firstly, applying rule 1, then rule 2, and then rule 3 to the numerator:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{\\sqrt[4]{x^5x^3}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} &= \\dfrac{\\sqrt[4]{x^8}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{(x^8)^{1/4}}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{x^2}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo simplify the denominator, we want to apply rule 2, then rule 3, and then rule 1:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{x^2}{\\sqrt[3]{x} \\sqrt[6]{x^3}} &= \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{1/3} (x^3)^{1/6}} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{1/3} x^{1/2}} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{5/6}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nRemember that we’ll need to get common denominators when adding the fractions at the end: \\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} &= \\frac{1\\times2}{3\\times2}  + \\frac{1\\times3}{2\\times3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{6}  + \\frac{3}{6} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5}{6}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFinally, applying rule 4 and simplifying,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{x^2}{x^{5/6}} &=x^2 \\times x^{-5/6} \\\\\n&= x^{2-5/6} \\\\\n&= x^{12/6-5/6} \\\\\n&= x^{7/6}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLots of work with fractions here!\nNow try these questions. Don’t worry if it takes a while to just solve one!\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.1 But why? Square roots\nAs promised here is an explanation of why \\(x^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]x\\).\nWhen we take a square root we look for the a number that when it is multiplied by it’s self we get the answer i.e. \\(? \\times ? = x\\). Since one \\(x\\) is the same as \\(x^1\\) we can rewrite out statement again:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} ? \\times ? &= x^1 \\\\\nx^? \\times x^? &= x^1 \\\\\nx^{?+?} &= x^1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This means \\(? + ? = 1\\) so \\(?=\\frac{1}{2}\\) so \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{x}\\).",

Since the function is of the form \\(y=f(g(x))\\), we are looking for the ‘inner’ function.\nSo, for \\(y=-(4x^2+1)^4\\), \\[\ng(x)=4x^2+1.\n\\]\nIf we now set \\(u=g(x)\\), we can rewrite \\(y\\) in terms of \\(u\\) such that \\(y=f(u)\\):\n\\[\ny=-u^4\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the two derivatives \\(\\frac{du}{dx}\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{du}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{dx}=8x, \\quad \\frac{dy}{du}=-4u^3\n\\]\nPlugging these into the chain rule:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dy}{dx} &= \\frac{du}{dx} \\times \\frac{dy}{du}, \\\\\n&= 8x \\times-4u^3, \\\\\n&= -32xu^3.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFinally, we need to express \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) only in terms of \\(x\\), so we must replace the \\(u\\) term using the initial substitution \\(u=4x^2+1\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} =-32x(4x^2+1)^3.\n\\]\nPhew! Time for a cup of tea, or maybe some more questions…",
